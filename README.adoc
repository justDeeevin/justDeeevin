=== Hello! 

I'm Devin. I'm a high school senior who probably spends too much time writing code. Almost entirely self-taught, I've been programming for about 8 years.

I use {account}/nix-config[NixOS] as my daily driver, and I code with {account}/nvim-config[Neovim]. I play lots of video games, and I'm currently hooked on Deadlock.

Lately I've become a bit of an avid Nix developer, and I've been trying to contribute actively to nixpkgs.

I'm currently on the https://pyro.host[Pyro] team, building infrastructure for the future.

Don't have a good day, have a great one.
