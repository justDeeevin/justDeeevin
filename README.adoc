=== Hello! 

I'm Devin. I'm a high school junior who probably spends too much time writing code. I'm almost entirely self-taught, and I've been programming for about 8 years.

I use {account}/nix-config[NixOS] at home and Windows on the go (Linux doesn't like my laptop's audio hardware). I code with {account}/nvim-config[Neovim]. I play lots of videogames, but mostly Counter-Strike.

Go check out {account}/nuhxboard[NuhxBoard], my current pet project that's shaping up to be pretty awesome.

Don't have a good day, have a great one.
