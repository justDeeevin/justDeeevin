=== Hello! 

I'm Devin. I'm a high school junior who probably spends too much time writing code. I'm almost entirely self-taught, and I've been programming for about 8 years.

I use {account}/nix-config[NixOS] as my daily driver. I code with {account}/nvim-config[Neovim]. I play lots of videogames, but mostly Counter-Strike (I've been getting into Elden Ring lately, though).

Right now I'm working on {account}/cheer-app[a full-stack mobile data collection app for a local nonprofit].

Don't have a good day, have a great one.
