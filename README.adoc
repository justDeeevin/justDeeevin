=== Hello! 

I'm Devin. I'm a high school senior who probably spends too much time writing code. I'm almost entirely self-taught, and I've been programming for about 8 years.

I use {account}/nix-config[NixOS] as my daily driver. I code with {account}/nvim-config[Neovim]. I play lots of videogames, and I'm currently hooked on Deadlock.

Alongside school, I'm working with https://pyro.host[Pyro] on a secret project, writing rust code for multiplayer game server infrastructure.

Don't have a good day, have a great one.
