=== Hello! 

I'm Devin. I'm a high school junior who probably spends too much time writing code. I'm almost entirely self-taught, and I've been programming for about 8 years. I mostly work in Rust these days, but I'm fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I can find my way around in plenty of other languages:

.Some of them
[%collapsible]
====
* Python
* C
* C++
* C#
* Java
====

I use {account}/nix-config[NixOS] at home and Windows on the go (Linux doesn't like my laptop's audio hardware). I code with {account}/nvim-config[Neovim]. I play lots of videogames, but mostly Counter-Strike.

Go check out {account}/nuhxboard[NuhxBoard], my current pet project that's shaping up to be pretty awesome.

Don't have a good day, have a great one.
